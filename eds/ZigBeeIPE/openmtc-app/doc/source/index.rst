Introduction
===============

The OpenMTC Python SDK aims to provide developers with a convenient yet flexible tool to write ETSI M2M compliant applications. This includes network applications (NAs), gateway application (GAs), device applications (DAs), as well as interworking proxies (xIPs).

Overview
=========

The OpenMTC Python SDK provides access to the interfaces of an ETSI M2M system in a fully object oriented way. It is possible to work either with a low-level access client or on a higher level interface. Please refer to the following sections for details:

Python
=======

As its name implies, the OpenMTC Python SDK is written in and for the Python programming language. Users should therefore have at least a certain knowledge of Python and its paradigms. For this matter, the following material is recommended:

* `The Python Homepage <http://www.python.org>`_
* `Expert Python Programming by Tarek Ziad√© <http://www.e-reading.by/bookreader.php/138816/Ziade_-_Expert_Python_programming.pdf>`_
* `Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python by David Goodger <http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html>`_
* `Assorted Video Tutorials <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/python>`_

Feedback
========

Please direct any comments or issues you are having to konrad.campowsky@fokus.fraunhofer.de.

Please let us know what you think. We are also very interested in any use case you are *not* able to implement with the SDK or if you find it difficult to do so.
