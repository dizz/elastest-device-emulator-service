# ElasTest Device Emulator Service

Elastest Device-Emulator Service (EDS) emulates the behaviors of 
sensors, actuators and smart devices. 

EDS follows a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The service in this context
 is a light-weight micro-service. Furthermore, several micro-services are 
linked together to achieve the goals of EDS. The aim of a micro-service in EDS
is to run the functions of an emulator for a device which could be a sensor,
actuator or a smart device.
  
Additionally a micro-service called FrontEnd connects to the other 
micro-services to provide a common interface for the user to access all micro-
services. 

The micro-services use [oneM2M](http://onem2m.org) for communication. Furthermore
an Interworking Proxy (IPE) is used to transfer data from a non-oneM2M domain 
to oneM2M domain. The available micro-services supporting oneM2M in the present
release of EDS are:
* ZigBeeIPE : Provides simulated data from brightness, pressure, movement,
humidity, temperature sensors. 
* MemsIPE : Provides simulated data from the accelerometer sensor containing 
values for x, y and z components of acceleration. 
* FrontEnd : Provides a user interface to interact with MemsIPE and ZigBeeIPE.
A user interface (UI) displays the data from micro-services. 
* rest_app : Provides an interaction UI using RESTful API.In order to use the 
facility of the EDS, its API is used. The API is based upon the 
latest (2.12) version of the Open Service Broker API. To this end there are some 
specific ElasTest extensions added.

EDS runs each micro-service in a docker container, the containers are linked 
together to link the micro-services.

# Clone the Project
```shell
#Clone the project to your system
#Alternatively, you can download the zip file from Github and unzip it
git clone git@github.com:elastest/elastest-device-emulator-service.git

#Change working directory to main project folder
cd elastest-device-emulator-service
```

# How to run
* Run EDS using docker-compose: This method allows docker to setup containers
and connect them in a custom network. All the IPEs register after 10 seconds with 
FrontEnd.

Start EDS using:  
```shell
chmod +x script/*
./script/startup-linux.sh
```
To stop EDS:
```shell
./script/teardown-linux.sh
```
* Run EDS on local machine : This is explained in the development documenation, as
it requires changing the default network configuration.

The EDS FrontEnd UI can be accessed from port 6065, FrontEnd gateway from port
8000 and rest_app on port 8080. 

It is important for MemsIPE to have "/dev/i2c-1" device node available on the 
host machine. Please make sure to stop and remove the stale containers. If running using
docker compose, it is advisable to remove docker bridge with name "build_eds_netowrk" 
before running startup-linux.sh script.

# Basic usage
The Frontend operates a gateway which accepts curl requests to return the 
simulated sensor data posted by MemsIPE and ZigBeeIPE in the JSON format on port 8000.
All the data that follows are simulated through EDS.

### Access EDS FrontEnd user interface

This user interface displays plots in real time the data received from various

link:

```shell
http://localhost:6065/static/eds.html
```

### Access API UI 
Swagger UI provides the RESTful API available with EDS. The linking of API to 
different IPE is to be done.
