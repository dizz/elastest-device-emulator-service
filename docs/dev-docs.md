### Architecture:
 ![EDS screenshot examaple](image/eds_arch.jpg)

The entire application EDS consists of many services such as- memsipe, rest_app, and frontend. We divide the architecture as follows:
 - sensor/actuator based services/application which uses m2m communication protocol.
 - Application to visualize all the data and metrics coming from the sensor/actuator based services/application, which uses m2m communication protocol.
 - Simple restfull communication based service or application
 
### Prepare development environment:

First install the following development tools:
 - [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux)
 - [Python 2.7 and 3+](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/)
 - Latest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
 
Now, clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/elastest/elastest-device-emulator-service/blob/master/).
 
### Development procedure:

  * Using  *PyCharm IDE*:
    * Load/open the projects from IDE:
      * Import *EDS* project from local repository using File > Open --> select the project name elastest-device-emulator-service
     
      
   * From *IDE and console*:
     * Run *prep-env.sh* from the console to install all OpenMTC dependencies and to create the environment for memsipe and frontend services.
          ```
       $cd eds/FrontEnd/openmtc-gevent
       $./prep-env.sh
       
          ```
    
   * Go to the rest_app directory and run following:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      ```
     This will install all the dependencies to run the service properly and even to integrate the service with other Elastest component such as EMP and ESM.
   
### Locally:
   ## Run the gateway
    ```
    $cd eds/FrontEnd/openmtc-gevent
    $./run_gscl
      
          ```
   ## Run the application/frontend
    ```
    $cd eds/FrontEnd
    $./frontend
      
          ```
   ## Run the sensor application/memsipe
    ```
    $cd eds/MemsIPE
    $./mems-ipe
      
          ```  
          
   Open a browser and in the address bar write- localhost:6065/static/eds.html
   
   
## Run from Docker:
 This method allows docker to setup containers
and connect them in a custom network named **elastest_elastest**. In order to run the docker-compose file at first we need to 
  create the custom network. All the sensors register after 10 seconds with 
FrontEnd. 

Create custom network:
```shell
docker network create elastest_elastest
```

Start EDS using:  
```shell
chmod +x script/*
./script/startup-linux.sh
```
To stop EDS:
```shell
./script/teardown-linux.sh 
```

Check the ip for the diffferent application running from the docker:
```shell
docker network inspect elastest_elastestâ€‹
```
It gives the following output:
```
